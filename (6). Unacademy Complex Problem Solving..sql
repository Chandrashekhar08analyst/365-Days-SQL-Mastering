-- Step 1: Create Tables and insert value in it.

-- Create the Person table
CREATE TABLE Person (
    PersonID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    Score INT
);

-- Insert values into the Person table
INSERT INTO Person (PersonID, Name, Score) VALUES
(1, 'Alice', 85),
(2, 'Bob', 90),
(3, 'Charlie', 75),
(4, 'David', 95),
(5, 'Eve', 80);

-- Create the Friend table
CREATE TABLE Friend (
    PersonID INT,
    FriendID INT,
    PRIMARY KEY (PersonID, FriendID),
    FOREIGN KEY (PersonID) REFERENCES Person(PersonID),
    FOREIGN KEY (FriendID) REFERENCES Person(PersonID)
);

-- Insert values into the Friend table
INSERT INTO Friend (PersonID, FriendID) VALUES
(1, 2),
(1, 3),
(2, 3),
(2, 4),
(3, 4),
(4, 5),
(5, 1);

-- Step 2: Problem Statement.

-- Step 3: Query for achive the goal.
WITH Person_Friends_Score AS (
SELECT f.personid AS PersonID, SUM(p.score) AS Total_Friend_Score, 
	COUNT(f.friendid) AS Total_Friends
FROM Person AS p 
INNER JOIN Friend AS f ON f.FriendID = p.PersonID
GROUP BY f.personid
ORDER BY PersonID
)
SELECT pf.PersonID, p.name AS PersonName,
pf.Total_Friends, pf.Total_Friend_Score
FROM Person_Friends_Score AS pf
