-- Step 1: Create Tables and Insert Sample Data
CREATE TABLE Customer_Contracts (
    customer_id INT,
    product_id INT,
    amount INT
);

INSERT INTO Customer_Contracts (customer_id, product_id, amount) VALUES
(1, 1, 1000),
(1, 3, 2000),
(1, 5, 1500),
(2, 2, 3000),
(2, 6, 2000);

CREATE TABLE Products (
    product_id INT,
    product_category VARCHAR(50),
    product_name VARCHAR(100)
);

INSERT INTO Products (product_id, product_category, product_name) VALUES
(1, 'Analytics', 'Azure Databricks'),
(2, 'Analytics', 'Azure Stream Analytics'),
(4, 'Containers', 'Azure Kubernetes Service'),
(5, 'Containers', 'Azure Service Fabric'),
(6, 'Compute', 'Virtual Machines'),
(7, 'Compute', 'Azure Functions');

-- Step 2: Problem Statement
/*
ðŸ’¡ Problem Statement

A Supercloud customer is defined as a customer who has purchased at least one product 
from every product category listed in the Products table.

ðŸŸ¢ Objective

-- Step 3: Solution Using Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
WITH Total_Categories AS (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT product_category) AS total_categories
    FROM Products
),
Customer_Categories AS (
    SELECT 
        c.customer_id,
        COUNT(DISTINCT p.product_category) AS categories_purchased
    FROM Customer_Contracts c
    INNER JOIN Products p
    ON c.product_id = p.product_id
    GROUP BY c.customer_id
)
SELECT customer_id
FROM Customer_Categories, Total_Categories
WHERE categories_purchased = total_categories;

-- Sol 2:
SELECT c.customer_id
FROM Customer_Contracts AS c
INNER JOIN Products AS p
ON c.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT p.product_category) = (
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT product_category)
    FROM Products
);
